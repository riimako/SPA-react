## :dart: About

The purpose of the challenge is to build a single page application with React,showing a list of items with
some information in each of them, and another page showing detailed
information of each item, based on the [Ricky & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

There will be two main screens in the app:

_Listing_:

• It will show a list of items coming from the API, with some information. Title
and image are mandatory.\
• The app will be able to order the items by (at least) the Title.\
• The app will be able to filter the items by some of the fields. It could be a
property from the items with any select or checkbox or a search field, or all
of them.

_Details_:

• It will show detailed information about the selected element.
